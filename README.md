Summary:

Based on this analysis, there is no positivity bias in the Vine reviews, as the percentage of Vine reviews which were 5-star was actually lower than the percentage of unpaid reviews which were 5-star.  Further analysis could include correlating star rating to particular products or correlating the number of reviews to a particular customer to target them for the Vine program.
